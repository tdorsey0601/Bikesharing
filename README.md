# Bikesharing
module 15
Overview of Project
For this weeks challenge we were giving the opportunity to show investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a great investment. One of the key stakeholders wanted to see a bike trip analysis to solidify the solid buisness proposal. For the analysis, Pandas was used to change the "tripduration" column which was extracted from NYC's Bike sharing database from an integer to a datetime datatype. Using the converted datatype, a set of visualizations were made describing: the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Results
For deliverable 1, a CVS file was extracted from a NYC bike sharing database to convert the trip duration datatype to one that can be easily analyzed through Tableau. Doing so helped us determine the number of bikes being used within the first few hours of the trip duration.

One of the main questions that needed an answer for our stakeholders is "Who is our main support and who can we improve on marketing for". The visual below shows the number of bikes being used within the first few hours of the trip duration by gender.

Then we wanted to figure the bike traffic. A heatmap was chosen to help show the patterns by weekday. It was noted that during the weekdays there was heavy usages right before regular work hours around 8AM and right after work hours around 5PM, except for Wednesdays.

Similar to above, we wanted to figure out "Which gender provides the most traffic throughout the week". Below we can see similar trends between the groups, but slight difference of males being more active.

For the final image we wanted to show the difference between the userbase: Subscriber vs Customers. Our data shows subscribers tend to be more active throughout the week, there was also more activity from female subscribers than males.

Summary
Men should be targeted in advertising because they are the primary user group.
Bikes should be located in densely populated locations.
Provide incentives to encourage everyday use during typical commuting hours during the week.
